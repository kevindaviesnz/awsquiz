This is very similar to hosting your own VMware or Hyper-V virtualized platforms,\nwhere you deploy servers, attach storage volumes, and configure network connectivity services. However, the primary difference is that\nyou do not have access to the underlying hypervisor platform with cloud-hosted IaaS solutions. IaaS offerings give the greatest amount of\ncontrol over how the virtual components of your infrastructure are configured and also require you to take responsibility for managing,\nmaintaining, and enforcing security measures for those components."

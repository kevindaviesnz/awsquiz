[q]
Which type of cloud service model is most like an on-premises environment, where you configure virtual infrastructure components
such as compute, network, and storage services that you can host your applications on?
[answers]
Software as a Service (SaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Function as a Service (FaaS)
[correct]
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
[explanation]
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service model that gives you access to virtualized infrastructure components comprising 
computing, network, and storage services. This is very similar to hosting your own VMware or Hyper-V virtualized platforms, 
where you deploy servers, attach storage volumes, and configure network connectivity services. However, the primary difference is that 
you do not have access to the underlying hypervisor platform with cloud-hosted IaaS solutions. IaaS offerings give the greatest amount of 
control over how the virtual components of your infrastructure are configured and also require you to take responsibility for managing, 
maintaining, and enforcing security measures for those components.

[q]
Your company is looking to move all its applications and services to the cloud but would like to migrate workloads in stages. 
This would require you to ensure that there is connectivity between the on-premises infrastructure and the applications you deploy on 
AWS for a while. What cloud deployment model would you need to establish?
[answers]
Private cloud
Public cloud
Hybrid cloud
Multi-cloud
[correct]
Hybrid cloud
[explanation]
Companies who wish to move their entire suite of applications to the cloud would normally carry out a series of migration projects over time. 
During this migration phase, connectivity between the on-premises environment and the AWS cloud would be required to facilitate the migration.
Many companies may also require a more permanent hybrid design architecture. This could be because certain types of applications need to be 
in much closer proximity to the on-premises infrastructure where users are based, such as your corporate office network, ultimately ensuring
low-latency access, data residency requirements, or even unique local data processing requirements. AWS offers several services to build hybrid
clouds from VPN technologies and Direct Connect services to offering on-premises services such as AWS Storage Gateway and AWS Outposts.

[q]
Which of the following statements are valid reasons for choosing a specific AWS Region to deploy your applications in? (Choose two)
[answers]
Your organization would choose a specific AWS Region that enables you to ensure that your applications are closer to your end users, thereby reducing any latency.
If your organization has specific compliance or data residency laws to follow, then your choice of an AWS Region will be dictated by this requirement.
Your organization would choose a Region closer to its location since your IT staff will need to visit the AWS data centers to set up servers and networking equipment.
Your organization would choose a Region-based location where your business has an established legal presence. This is because you cannot access other Regions unless you have a legal establishment in that Region.
Your organization would select an AWS Region that offered higher variable costs but lower upfront costs.
[correct]
Your organization would choose a specific AWS Region that enables you to ensure that your applications are closer to your end users, thereby reducing any latency.
If your organization has specific compliance or data residency laws to follow, then your choice of an AWS Region will be dictated by this requirement.
[explanation]
There are several reasons why you would choose a specific AWS Region to deploy your applications in, including the need for closer proximity
to your end users and thus to reduce latency, data residence laws, regulatory requirements, the choice of services available, and costs.

[q]
Which component of the AWS Global Infrastructure enables you to cache content (videos, images, and documents) and offer low-latency 
access when your users try to download them?
[answers]
AWS Regions
Availability Zones
Edge locations
Local Zones
[correct]
Edge locations
[explanation]
Edge locations are AWS infrastructure facilities located across the globe that help cache content for Amazon CloudFront. Any content that is 
accessed from the origin is cached locally at one or more edge locations closer to users to access that content for a particular time to 
live (TTL). This way, repeated access to the same content is delivered over a low latency connection.

[q]
Which of the following AWS services can help you design a hybrid cloud architecture and enable your on-premises applications to get access 
to Amazon S3 cloud storage?
[answers]
Amazon Snowball Edge
AWS Storage Gateway
Amazon Elastic Block Store
Amazon CloudFront
[correct]
AWS Storage Gateway
[explanation]
AWS Storage Gateway enables you to build hybrid cloud solutions by giving access to the Amazon S3 and Glacier environments from your 
on-premises network. You install and configure the gateway appliance at your on-premises location and can use any one of four gateway types 
to access unlimited storage in the cloud. These gateway types are Amazon S3 File Gateway, Amazon FSx File Gateway, Tape Gateway, and 
Volume Gateway

[q]
You are planning on using AWS services to host an application that is still under development, and you need to decide which AWS support 
plan you should subscribe to. You do not need production-level support currently and are happy with a 12-hour response time for any 
system-impaired issues. Which is the most cost-effective support plan you should subscribe to?
[answers]
Basic Support plan
Developer Support plan
Business Support plan
Enterprise Support plan
[correct]
Developer Support plan
[explanation]
The Developer Support plan gives you access to technical support via email and chats only. This support plan is cheaper than the Business 
and Enterprise Support plans and is recommended for experimenting with or testing applications on AWS.

[q]
Which of the following are regarded as global services on AWS? (Choose two)
[answers]
AWS IAM
Amazon Route53
Amazon EC
Amazon EFS
Amazon RDS
[correct]
AWS IAM
Amazon Route53
[explanation]
Several services are configured from a global perspective on AWS. For example, with IAM, every IAM user in your AWS account 
is unique across the entire AWS Global Infrastructure. The same applies to Amazon Route53, where domain names configured in 
host zones have a global presence across all Regions on AWS. Another global service on AWS is Amazon CloudFront.

[q]
Which of the following statements closely relates to the advantage of cloud computing that discusses the ability to go global in minutes?
[answers]
The ability to trade capital expenses for variable expenses and thus avoid huge CAPEX.
The ability to provision resources just in time for when you need them using tools such as Auto Scaling.
The ability to deploy your applications across multiple Regions with just a few mouse clicks.
The ability to focus on experimentation and the development of your applications rather than infrastructure builds, management, and maintenance.
[correct]
The ability to deploy your applications across multiple Regions with just a few mouse clicks.
[explanation]
One of the six advantages of cloud computing is the ability to go global in minutes. This is made possible because, as an AWS customer, 
you have access to all Regions and Availability Zones where you can provision the resources required to host your application 
in a matter of minutes.

[q]
Which AWS service can you configure to send out an alert to an email address if your total expenditure crosses a predefined monthly cost?
[answers]
Set up a billing alarm in Amazon CloudWatch
Set up a billing alarm in Amazon CloudTrail
Set up a billing alarm in Amazon Config
Set up a billing blarm in Amazon Trusted Advisor
[correct]
Set up a billing alarm in Amazon CloudWatch
[explanation]
Amazon CloudWatch enables you to set up alarms that can be triggered when a particular threshold is crossed. You can set up an alarm for 
billing alerts that monitors when your total spend crosses a specified dollar amount. This alarm can be configured to send out an alert
to an email address that uses the Amazon SNS service.


[q]
Which of the following resource types is tied to the Availability Zone that it was launched in?
[answers]
Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Elastic File Store (EFS)
Amazon Route53 Hosted Zones
Amazon DynamoDB
[correct]
Elastic Block Store (EBS)
[explanation]
Amazon EBS is like the virtual hard disks (volumes) that you attach to EC2 instances. They need to be provisioned in the same availability where the EC2 instance has been launched to be attached to that EC2 instance. Furthermore, you cannot attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. You could take a snapshot of the EBS volume and launch a new volume in another Availability Zone from that snapshot if required.

[q]			
As part of enhancing the security of your AWS account, you need to ensure that all IAM users use complex passwords comprising of 
at least one capital letter, a number, a symbol, and a minimum of 9 characters. Which AWS IAM feature can you use to configure 
these requirements?
[answers]
Password policies
Permission boundaries
Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Resource policies
[correct]
Password policies
[explanation]
AWS IAM Password Policies enable you to define custom policies on your AWS account to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for your IAM users' passwords. This ensures that IAM user accounts are created with complex, hard-to-crack passwords.

[q]
As a recommended best practice, what additional authentication security measure can you implement for your root user and IAM users?
[answers]
Implement MFA.
Implement LastPass.
Implement AWS WAF.
Implement AWS Shield.
[correct]
Implement MFA.
[explanation]
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a recommended best practice authentication security measure. It requires you to authenticate with a username and password, as well as a security token generated by a physical or virtual device you own. Used together, these factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.

[q]
What is the easiest way to assign permissions to many IAM users who share a common job function?
[answers]
Create a customer-managed IAM policy and attach the same policies to all IAM users who share a common job function.
Create an IAM Group, add IAM users who share the common job function to that group, and apply an IAM policy to the group with the necessary permissions.
Create an SCP to restrict users who share a common job function for specific permissions.
Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions and assign the role to all IAM users who share the common job function.
[correct]
Create an IAM Group, add IAM users who share the common job function to that group, and apply an IAM policy to the group with the necessary permissions.
[explanation]
An IAM Group can be used to club users who share common job functions. You can then assign the necessary permissions to the IAM Group, which will filter down to the IAM users that are members of the group.Where possible, entities that need access to services and resources on AWS ought to be granted access via IAM roles using temporary security credentials. For example, users who need to access resources in another AWS account can be granted permission to assume a role rather than having to create IAM accounts for them in the other account. This is considered best practice and AWS highly recommends this approach.


[q]
You have outsourced the development of your application to a third-party provider. This provider will require temporary access to your 
AWS account to set up the necessary infrastructure and deploy the application. What type of identity should you configure for the provider 
to use to gain access?
[answers]
IAM User
IAM Group
IAM role
Root user
[correct]
IAM role
[explanation]
An IAM role enables you to grant external users access to resources in your AWS account using temporary credentials that are managed by the AWS Security Token Service (STS). An IAM role will also have an IAM policy attached to it that specifies the exact set of permissions the role will grant to the external user(s).

[q]
Which tool on AWS can be used to estimate your monthly costs?
[answers]
AWS Pricing Calculator
AWS TCO Calculator
AWS Free Tier Calculator
AWS Monthly Calculator
[correct]
AWS Pricing Calculator
[explanation]
AWS Pricing Calculator can help you estimate the monthly costs of the resources you wish to provision on AWS. In addition to specifying the expected usage for the month, to calculate the cost of the resources, you can provide additional details such as the amount of data transferred in and out of the AWS Region and cross-Region to get a complete estimate.




[q]
You need to differentiate the cost of running different workloads in your AWS account by business unit and department. How you can identify 
your resources, as well as their owners, in the billing reports generated by AWS?
[answers]
Designate specific tags as cost allocation tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console.
Set up an SNS alert for each department.
Create a billing alarm.
Configure consolidated billing in AWS Organizations.
[correct]
Designate specific tags as cost allocation tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console.
[explanation]
You can use cost allocation tags to identify your resource costs on your cost allocation report and track your AWS costs by resources and who owns them. AWS provides two types of cost allocation tags: AWS-generated tags and user-defined tags.




[q]             
Which AWS tool enables you to view your Reserved Instance (RI) utilization?
[answers]
AWS Cost Explorer
AWS Config
AWS CloudTrail
AWS Personal Health Dashboard
[correct]
AWS Cost Explorer
[explanation]
AWS Cost Explorer enables you to view 12 months of usage and spending data, as well as a forecast of what your future costs will be for the next 12 months. Cost Explorer can also provide information on how much of your RI you have utilized, as well as the savings that have been made from using RIs over on-demand options for EC2 Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, and more.



[q]		
Which set of credentials do you need to configure for IAM users who need to access your AWS account via the command-line interface (CLI)?
[answers]
IAM username and password
IAM access key ID and secret access key
IAM MFA
IAM key pairs
[correct]
IAM access key ID and secret access key
[explanation]
To access an AWS account as an IAM user, you need to create a set of access keys, which is a combination of an access key ID and a secret access key. Note these keys are considered long-term access keys. One set of keys is associated with a specific IAM use



[q]
An application is to be deployed on EC2 instances that will need to access an Amazon S3 bucket to upload any artifacts that are created. 
Which security option is considered a best practice to grant the application running on the EC2 instances the necessary 
permissions to upload files to the Amazon S3 bucket?
[answers]
Create an IAM user account with a set of access keys and assign the required level of permissions using an IAM policy. Hardcode the application with the access keys.
Create an IAM user account with a username and password and assign the required level of permissions using an IAM policy. Hardcode the application with the username and password.
Create an IAM role with the required level of permissions using an IAM policy. Attach the role to the application running on the EC2 instance.
Create an IAM role with the required level of permissions using an IAM policy. Attach the role to the EC2 instances that will host the application.
[correct]
Create an IAM role with the required level of permissions using an IAM policy. Attach the role to the EC2 instances that will host the application.
[explanation]
You can create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to upload objects to a specific Amazon S3 bucket. You should then deploy your EC2 instances with this role attached (this involves creating an instance profile associated with the role). The IAM role will enable the application running on the EC2 instance to access the Amazon S3 bucket. Using an IAM role, the EC2 instance will obtain temporary credentials from the Security Token Service (STS).




[q]
Which AWS service enables you to troubleshoot IAM policies by identifying which set of permissions are allowed and which are denied?
[answers]
AWS Policy Simulator
AWS Policy Manager
AWS CloudTrail
AWS SCPs
[correct]
AWS Policy Simulator
[explanation]
AWS Policy Simulator can help you identify which set of policies are allowed and which are denied against specific identities, groups of identities, and IAM roles. You can obtain granular visibility into specific permissions that have been allowed and denied, helping you troubleshoot access issues.



[q]		
As part of your regular compliance processes, you are required to regularly audit the list of your IAM users and review information such as 
if they have been configured with passwords and access keys, as well as if MFA has been enabled on those accounts.
Which AWS IAM service enables you to produce regular reports containing the preceding information?
[answers]
IAM Credentials Report
IAM MFA Report
AWS CloudWatch
AWS Config
[correct]
IAM Credentials Report
[explanation]
The IAM Credentials Report enables you to review IAM user accounts created in your AWS account.

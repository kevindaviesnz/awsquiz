[q]
Which type of cloud service model is most like an on-premises environment, where you configure virtual infrastructure components
such as compute, network, and storage services that you can host your applications on?
[answers]
Software as a Service (SaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Function as a Service (FaaS)
[correct]
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
[explanation]
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud service model that gives you access to virtualized infrastructure components comprising 
computing, network, and storage services. This is very similar to hosting your own VMware or Hyper-V virtualized platforms, 
where you deploy servers, attach storage volumes, and configure network connectivity services. However, the primary difference is that 
you do not have access to the underlying hypervisor platform with cloud-hosted IaaS solutions. IaaS offerings give the greatest amount of 
control over how the virtual components of your infrastructure are configured and also require you to take responsibility for managing, 
maintaining, and enforcing security measures for those components.

[q]
Your company is looking to move all its applications and services to the cloud but would like to migrate workloads in stages. 
This would require you to ensure that there is connectivity between the on-premises infrastructure and the applications you deploy on 
AWS for a while. What cloud deployment model would you need to establish?
[answers]
Private cloud
Public cloud
Hybrid cloud
Multi-cloud
[correct]
Hybrid cloud
[explanation]
Companies who wish to move their entire suite of applications to the cloud would normally carry out a series of migration projects over time. 
During this migration phase, connectivity between the on-premises environment and the AWS cloud would be required to facilitate the migration.
Many companies may also require a more permanent hybrid design architecture. This could be because certain types of applications need to be 
in much closer proximity to the on-premises infrastructure where users are based, such as your corporate office network, ultimately ensuring
low-latency access, data residency requirements, or even unique local data processing requirements. AWS offers several services to build hybrid
clouds from VPN technologies and Direct Connect services to offering on-premises services such as AWS Storage Gateway and AWS Outposts.

[q]
Which of the following statements are valid reasons for choosing a specific AWS Region to deploy your applications in? (Choose two)
[answers]
Your organization would choose a specific AWS Region that enables you to ensure that your applications are closer to your end users, thereby reducing any latency.
If your organization has specific compliance or data residency laws to follow, then your choice of an AWS Region will be dictated by this requirement.
Your organization would choose a Region closer to its location since your IT staff will need to visit the AWS data centers to set up servers and networking equipment.
Your organization would choose a Region-based location where your business has an established legal presence. This is because you cannot access other Regions unless you have a legal establishment in that Region.
Your organization would select an AWS Region that offered higher variable costs but lower upfront costs.
[correct]
Your organization would choose a specific AWS Region that enables you to ensure that your applications are closer to your end users, thereby reducing any latency.
If your organization has specific compliance or data residency laws to follow, then your choice of an AWS Region will be dictated by this requirement.
[explanation]
There are several reasons why you would choose a specific AWS Region to deploy your applications in, including the need for closer proximity
to your end users and thus to reduce latency, data residence laws, regulatory requirements, the choice of services available, and costs.

[answers]
AWS IAM
Amazon Route53
Amazon EC
Amazon EFS
Amazon RDS
[correct]
AWS IAM
Amazon Route53
[explanation]
Several services are configured from a global perspective on AWS. For example, with IAM, every IAM user in your AWS account 
is unique across the entire AWS Global Infrastructure. The same applies to Amazon Route53, where domain names configured in 
host zones have a global presence across all Regions on AWS. Another global service on AWS is Amazon CloudFront.

[q]
Which of the following statements closely relates to the advantage of cloud computing that discusses the ability to go global in minutes?
[answers]
The ability to trade capital expenses for variable expenses and thus avoid huge CAPEX.
The ability to provision resources just in time for when you need them using tools such as Auto Scaling.
The ability to deploy your applications across multiple Regions with just a few mouse clicks.
The ability to focus on experimentation and the development of your applications rather than infrastructure builds, management, and maintenance.
[correct]
The ability to deploy your applications across multiple Regions with just a few mouse clicks.
[explanation]
One of the six advantages of cloud computing is the ability to go global in minutes. This is made possible because, as an AWS customer, 
you have access to all Regions and Availability Zones where you can provision the resources required to host your application 
in a matter of minutes.

billing alerts that monitors when your total spend crosses a specified dollar amount. This alarm can be configured to send out an alert
to an email address that uses the Amazon SNS service.


[q]
Which of the following resource types is tied to the Availability Zone that it was launched in?
[answers]
Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Elastic File Store (EFS)
Amazon Route53 Hosted Zones
Amazon DynamoDB
[correct]
Elastic Block Store (EBS)
[explanation]
Amazon EBS is like the virtual hard disks (volumes) that you attach to EC2 instances. They need to be provisioned in the same availability where the EC2 instance has been launched to be attached to that EC2 instance. Furthermore, you cannot attach an EBS volume to an EC2 instance in another Availability Zone. You could take a snapshot of the EBS volume and launch a new volume in another Availability Zone from that snapshot if required.

[q]			
As part of enhancing the security of your AWS account, you need to ensure that all IAM users use complex passwords comprising of 
at least one capital letter, a number, a symbol, and a minimum of 9 characters. Which AWS IAM feature can you use to configure 
these requirements?
[answers]
Password policies
Permission boundaries
Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Resource policies
[correct]
Password policies
[explanation]
AWS IAM Password Policies enable you to define custom policies on your AWS account to specify complexity requirements and mandatory rotation periods for your IAM users' passwords. This ensures that IAM user accounts are created with complex, hard-to-crack passwords.

[q]

[answers]
Implement MFA.
Implement LastPass.
Implement AWS WAF.
Implement AWS Shield.
[correct]
Implement MFA.
[explanation]
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a recommended best practice authentication security measure. It requires you to authenticate with a username and password, as well as a security token generated by a physical or virtual device you own. Used together, these factors provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.

[q]
What is the easiest way to assign permissions to many IAM users who share a common job function?
[answers]
Create a customer-managed IAM policy and attach the same policies to all IAM users who share a common job function.
Create an IAM Group, add IAM users who share the common job function to that group, and apply an IAM policy to the group with the necessary permissions.
Create an SCP to restrict users who share a common job function for specific permissions.
Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions and assign the role to all IAM users who share the common job function.
[correct]
Create an IAM Group, add IAM users who share the common job function to that group, and apply an IAM policy to the group with the necessary permissions.
[explanation]
An IAM Group can be used to club users who share common job functions. You can then assign the necessary permissions to the IAM Group, which will filter down to the IAM users that are members of the group.Where possible, entities that need access to services and resources on AWS ought to be granted access via IAM roles using temporary security credentials. For example, users who need to access resources in another AWS account can be granted permission to assume a role rather than having to create IAM accounts for them in the other account. This is considered best practice and AWS highly recommends this approach.


[q]
You have outsourced the development of your application to a third-party provider. This provider will require temporary access to your 
AWS account to set up the necessary infrastructure and deploy the application. What type of identity should you configure for the provider 
to use to gain access?
[answers]
IAM User
IAM Group
IAM role
Root user
[correct]
IAM role
[explanation]
An IAM role enables you to grant external users access to resources in your AWS account using temporary credentials that are managed by the AWS Security Token Service (STS). An IAM role will also have an IAM policy attached to it that specifies the exact set of permissions the role will grant to the external user(s).

[correct]
Create an IAM role with the required level of permissions using an IAM policy. Attach the role to the EC2 instances that will host the application.
[explanation]
You can create an IAM role with the necessary permissions to upload objects to a specific Amazon S3 bucket. You should then deploy your EC2 instances with this role attached (this involves creating an instance profile associated with the role). The IAM role will enable the application running on the EC2 instance to access the Amazon S3 bucket. Using an IAM role, the EC2 instance will obtain temporary credentials from the Security Token Service (STS).

[q]
Following best practices, you have deployed your application servers within the private subnets of a VPC. However, these servers require 
internet access to download updates and security patches. Which type of resource can enable you to grant internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets without having to assign public IP addresses to those instances?
[answers]
Internet gateway
NAT gateway
Subnet
Route table
[correct]
NAT gateway
[explanation]
NAT gateways help relay outbound requests to the internet on behalf of EC2 instances configured to use them. The NAT gateway replaces the source IPv4 address of your EC2 instances with the private IP address of the NAT gateway, thus acting as a proxy. Response traffic is then redirected by the NAT gateway back to the private IP address of the EC2 instance that made the original request.



[q]
Which of the following statements is true about security groups?
[answers]
Security groups are stateful and you need to configure both inbound and the corresponding outbound rules for traffic to flow bidirectionally.
Security groups are stateless and you do not need to configure both inbound and the corresponding outbound rules for traffic to flow bidirectionally.
Security groups can be used to explicitly deny inbound traffic from a specific IP address range.
Security groups are used to limit what actions IAM users that are members of the group can perform.
[correct]
Security groups are stateless and you do not need to configure both inbound and the corresponding outbound rules for traffic to flow bidirectionally.
[explanation]
Security groups are stateful. This means that even if you have not configured any inbound rules, response traffic to any outbound requests will be permitted inbound by the Security Group. Similarly, if you configured any inbound rules, outbound response traffic to any inbound traffic is permitted, without you having to explicitly create those outbound rules.

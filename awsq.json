A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the\nresources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic\nfor the instance. In AWS, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are an additional layer of security for controlling traffic in and out of subnets within a\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC). While Security Groups act as stateful firewalls at the instance level, NACLs operate at the subnet level and provide stateless\ntraffic filtering. A network access control list (ACL) allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level. You can use the default\nnetwork ACL for your VPC, or you can create a custom network ACL for your VPC with rules that are similar to the rules for your security groups in order to\nadd an additional layer of security to your VPC."

You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.\nA listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. When the conditions for a rule are met, then its actions are performed. You must define a default rule for each listener, and you can optionally define additional rules.\nEach target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify. You can register a target with multiple target groups. You can configure health checks on a per target group basis.

Amazon\nDynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides automatic backups of your DynamoDB table data.

RTO stands for Recovery Time Objective and is\na measure of how quickly after an outage an application must be available again. RPO, or Recovery Point Objective, refers to how much data loss your application can tolerate.\nAnother way to think about RPO is how old can the data be when this application is recovered? With both RTO and RPO, the targets are measured in hours, minutes,\nor seconds, with lower numbers representing less downtime or less data loss.

An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.\nAn IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However,\ninstead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

RIs provide a way to reduce the overall cost of\nrunning EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other AWS resources by committing to a predefined usage term. Reserved Instances provide you with\nsignificant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather\na billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes, such as\ninstance type and Region, in order to benefit from the billing discount.\nAWS Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provide significant savings on AWS usage costs in\nexchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in dollars per hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term. Savings Plans offer a\nsimpler and more flexible alternative to Reserved Instances (RIs) and provide automatic savings on eligible EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and\nFargate usage, regardless of instance family, size, region, operating system, or tenancy.\nSavings Plans is a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your bill by up to 72% compared to On-Demand prices, in exchange for a one- or\nthree-year hourly spend commitment. AWS offers three types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, and\nAmazon SageMaker Savings Plans.\nAWS recommends Savings Plans over Reserved Instances. Saving Plans are the easiest and most flexible way to save money on your AWS compute costs\nand offer lower prices (up to 72% off On-Demand pricing), just like Reserved Instances. However, Savings Plans are different to Reserved Instances.\nWith Reserved Instances, you make a commitment to a specific instance configuration, whereas with Savings Plans, you have the flexibility to use\nthe instance configurations that best meet your needs."

For example, you could have a user group called Admins and give that user group typical administrator permissions.\nAny user in that user group automatically has Admins group permissions. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges\nyou can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to the Admins user group. If a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of\nediting that user's permissions you can remove them from the old user groups and add them to the appropriate new user groups."

This enables\nyour users to use their existing corporate credentials to access AWS resources without having to create separate IAM user accounts for each user.\nWhen a user attempts to access AWS resources, they are redirected to the corporate identity provider's login page for authentication. Once authenticated,\nthe identity provider issues a security token that grants the user access to AWS services.\nA federated identity is a user that can access secure AWS account resources with external identities. External identities can come from a\ncorporate identity store (such as LDAP or Windows Active Directory) or from a third party (such as Login in with Amazon, Facebook, or Google).\nFederated identities don't sign in with the AWS Management Console or AWS access portal. The type of external identity in use determines how\nfederated identities sign in."

The Application Load Balancer operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and is ideal for routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic to different targets based on URL paths or hostnames. The Network Load Balancer operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and provides ultra-low latency and high throughput for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic. The Classic Load Balancer is the legacy load balancer offering that works at both the application and transport layers, supporting HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL protocols."

Elastic IP addresses are static IPv4 addresses that you can allocate and associate with your EC2 instances, providing persistent and fixed public IP addresses for your instances that remain associated with them until you choose to release or disassociate the addresses. While AWS allows you to allocate up to 5 EIPs per account, it's important to use them judiciously and consider alternative solutions such as using dynamic public IP addresses or leveraging NAT gateways and Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) where applicable to minimize the need for static IP addresses and optimize resource utilization and cost efficiency in your AWS environment."

You pay only for the compute capacity you consume, making on-demand instances ideal for short-term, temporary workloads with unpredictable usage patterns.\nSpot Instances: Spot instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity at discounted prices compared to on-demand rates. You specify the maximum price you're willing to pay per hour for instances, and if your bid exceeds the current Spot market price, your instances are provisioned and run until the Spot price exceeds your bid or your instances are terminated by AWS due to capacity constraints.\nReserved Instances: Reserved instances offer significant cost savings compared to on-demand rates by allowing you to commit to a specific instance type in a specific region for a one- or three-year term. In exchange for making a upfront payment or choosing a partial upfront or no upfront payment option, you receive a discounted hourly rate for the duration of the reservation term, providing predictable pricing and long-term savings for steady-state workloads with predictable usage patterns."

SNS provides features such as message filtering, message attributes, and message encryption, enabling you to build flexible and resilient messaging workflows in the cloud.\nAmazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS)."

A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the\nresources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic\nfor the instance. In AWS, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are an additional layer of security for controlling traffic in and out of subnets within a\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC). While Security Groups act as stateful firewalls at the instance level, NACLs operate at the subnet level and provide stateless\ntraffic filtering. A network access control list (ACL) allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level. You can use the default\nnetwork ACL for your VPC, or you can create a custom network ACL for your VPC with rules that are similar to the rules for your security groups in order to\nadd an additional layer of security to your VPC."

You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.\nA listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. When the conditions for a rule are met, then its actions are performed. You must define a default rule for each listener, and you can optionally define additional rules.\nEach target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify. You can register a target with multiple target groups. You can configure health checks on a per target group basis.

Amazon\nDynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides automatic backups of your DynamoDB table data.

RTO stands for Recovery Time Objective and is\na measure of how quickly after an outage an application must be available again. RPO, or Recovery Point Objective, refers to how much data loss your application can tolerate.\nAnother way to think about RPO is how old can the data be when this application is recovered? With both RTO and RPO, the targets are measured in hours, minutes,\nor seconds, with lower numbers representing less downtime or less data loss.

AWS CAF identifies specific organizational capabilities that underpin successful cloud transformations. These capabilities\nprovide best practice guidance that helps you improve your cloud readiness. AWS CAF groups its capabilities in six perspectives:\nBusiness, People, Governance, Platform, Security, and Operations. Each perspective comprises a set of capabilities that functionally related stakeholders own or\nmanage in the cloud transformation journey. Use the AWS CAF to identify and prioritize transformation opportunities, evaluate and improve your cloud readiness,\nand iteratively evolve your transformation roadmap.\nBusiness\nThe Business perspective helps ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes. Common stakeholders include chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief operations officer (COO), chief information officer (CIO), and chief technology officer (CTO).\nPeople\nThe People perspective serves as a bridge between technology and business, accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning, and where change becomes business-as-normal, with focus on culture, organizational structure, leadership, and workforce. Common stakeholders include CIO, COO, CTO, cloud director, and cross-functional and enterprise-wide leaders.\nGovernance\nThe Governance perspective helps you orchestrate your cloud initiatives while maximizing organizational benefits and minimizing transformation-related risks. Common stakeholders include chief transformation officer, CIO, CTO, CFO, chief data officer (CDO), and chief risk officer (CRO).\nPlatform\nThe Platform perspective helps you build an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform, modernize existing workloads, and implement new cloud-native solutions. Common stakeholders include CTO, technology leaders, architects, and engineers.\nSecurity\nThe Security perspective helps you achieve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data and cloud workloads. Common stakeholders include chief information security officer (CISO), chief compliance officer (CCO), internal audit leaders, and security architects and engineers.\nOperations\nThe Operations perspective helps ensure that your cloud services are delivered at a level that meets the needs of your business.

An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.\nAn IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However,\ninstead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

RIs provide a way to reduce the overall cost of\nrunning EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other AWS resources by committing to a predefined usage term. Reserved Instances provide you with\nsignificant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather\na billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes, such as\ninstance type and Region, in order to benefit from the billing discount.\nAWS Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provide significant savings on AWS usage costs in\nexchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in dollars per hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term. Savings Plans offer a\nsimpler and more flexible alternative to Reserved Instances (RIs) and provide automatic savings on eligible EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and\nFargate usage, regardless of instance family, size, region, operating system, or tenancy.\nSavings Plans is a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your bill by up to 72% compared to On-Demand prices, in exchange for a one- or\nthree-year hourly spend commitment. AWS offers three types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, and\nAmazon SageMaker Savings Plans.\nAWS recommends Savings Plans over Reserved Instances. Saving Plans are the easiest and most flexible way to save money on your AWS compute costs\nand offer lower prices (up to 72% off On-Demand pricing), just like Reserved Instances. However, Savings Plans are different to Reserved Instances.\nWith Reserved Instances, you make a commitment to a specific instance configuration, whereas with Savings Plans, you have the flexibility to use\nthe instance configurations that best meet your needs."

By grouping users together, you can assign permissions to multiple users\nsimultaneously, making it easier to manage access control in AWS.\nAn IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage\nthe permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called Admins and give that user group typical administrator permissions.\nAny user in that user group automatically has Admins group permissions. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges\nyou can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to the Admins user group. If a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of\nediting that user's permissions you can remove them from the old user groups and add them to the appropriate new user groups."

This enables\nyour users to use their existing corporate credentials to access AWS resources without having to create separate IAM user accounts for each user.\nWhen a user attempts to access AWS resources, they are redirected to the corporate identity provider's login page for authentication. Once authenticated,\nthe identity provider issues a security token that grants the user access to AWS services.\nA federated identity is a user that can access secure AWS account resources with external identities. External identities can come from a\ncorporate identity store (such as LDAP or Windows Active Directory) or from a third party (such as Login in with Amazon, Facebook, or Google).\nFederated identities don't sign in with the AWS Management Console or AWS access portal. The type of external identity in use determines how\nfederated identities sign in."

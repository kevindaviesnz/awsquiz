[explanation]
A Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in AWS is a managed network load balancer service that helps distribute incoming internet traffic across multiple 
targets within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It operates at the network (Layer 3) level of the OSI model, making it suitable for routing traffic to a 
wide range of network-based services. Gateway Load Balancer helps you easily deploy, scale, and manage your third-party virtual appliances. It gives you one gateway 
for distributing traffic across multiple virtual appliances while scaling them up or down, based on demand. A Load Balancer Endpoint in AWS refers to the 
network interface that represents a load balancer within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It serves as the entry point for incoming traffic from clients and routes 
that traffic to the appropriate target instances or services based on configured rules. A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint is a VPC endpoint that provides private 
connectivity between virtual appliances in the service provider VPC, and application servers in the service consumer VPC. The Gateway Load Balancer is deployed 
in the same VPC as that of the virtual appliances. These appliances are registered as a target group of the Gateway Load Balancer.

[q]
Which of the following services can be used to block network traffic to an instance? (Choose two.)

[answers]
Security groups
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs
Network ACLS
Amazon CloudWatch
AWS CloudTrail
[correct]
Security groups
Network ACLS
[explanation]
In AWS, Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to and from AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, RDS instances, 
and Elastic Load Balancers (ELB). They act as a first line of defense for your AWS infrastructure by allowing you to define rules that specify the type of 
traffic allowed or denied based on protocol, port, and IP address ranges. A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the 
resources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic 
for the instance. In AWS, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are an additional layer of security for controlling traffic in and out of subnets within a 
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). While Security Groups act as stateful firewalls at the instance level, NACLs operate at the subnet level and provide stateless 
traffic filtering. A network access control list (ACL) allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level. You can use the default 
network ACL for your VPC, or you can create a custom network ACL for your VPC with rules that are similar to the rules for your security groups in order to 
add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.
[correct]
Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
[explanation]
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a load balancing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, 
such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions, within one or more Availability Zones. ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the 
OSI model and offers advanced features for routing, security, and monitoring of HTTP and HTTPS traffic. A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application. You add one or more listeners to your load balancer.

A listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets. Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions. When the conditions for a rule are met, then its actions are performed. You must define a default rule for each listener, and you can optionally define additional rules.

Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify. You can register a target with multiple target groups. You can configure health checks on a per target group basis. Health checks are performed on all targets registered to a target group that is specified in a listener rule for your load balancer.

[q]
A company runs a shopping application that uses Amazon DynamoDB to store customer information. In case of data corruption, a solutions architect needs to design
a solution that meets a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recoverty time objective (RTO) of 1 hour.

What should the solutions architect recommend to meets these requirements?

[answers]
Configure DynamoDB global tables. For RPO recovery, point the application to a different AWS region.
Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.
Export the DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 Glacier on a daily basis. For RPO recovery, import the data from S3 Glacier to DynamoDB.
Schedule Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots for the DynamoDB table every 15 minutes. For RPO recovery, restore the DynamoDB table by using the EBS snapshot.
[correct]
Configure DynamoDB point-in-time recovery. For RPO recovery, restore to the desired point in time.
[explanation]
In AWS, point-in-time recovery (PITR) is a feature offered by various AWS services, such as Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and Amazon DynamoDB, 
that allows you to restore your data to a specific point in time, typically before an accidental deletion, corruption, or data loss event occurred. Amazon 
DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides automatic backups of your DynamoDB table data. In AWS, Recovery Time Objective (RTO) refers to the targeted duration 
within which a business aims to restore its IT services, systems, or applications after a disruption or disaster occurs. RTO stands for Recovery Time Objective and is 
a measure of how quickly after an outage an application must be available again. RPO, or Recovery Point Objective, refers to how much data loss your application can tolerate. 
Another way to think about RPO is how old can the data be when this application is recovered? With both RTO and RPO, the targets are measured in hours, minutes, 
or seconds, with lower numbers representing less downtime or less data loss. Within the context of a Business Continuity Plan, applications having similar RTO targets 
are grouped together in Tiers, with Tier 0 having the lowest RTO.

[answers]
Spot instances
On-Demand instances
Reserved instances
Saving plans
Dedicated hosts
[correct]
Reserved instances
Saving plans
[explanation]
Reserved Instances (RIs) are a purchasing option provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow customers to reserve capacity in the AWS cloud for 
a specific duration in exchange for a significant discount compared to On-Demand instance pricing. RIs provide a way to reduce the overall cost of 
running EC2 instances, RDS databases, and other AWS resources by committing to a predefined usage term. Reserved Instances provide you with 
significant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather 
a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes, such as 
instance type and Region, in order to benefit from the billing discount.
AWS Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provide significant savings on AWS usage costs in 
exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in dollars per hour) for a 1-year or 3-year term. Savings Plans offer a 
simpler and more flexible alternative to Reserved Instances (RIs) and provide automatic savings on eligible EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and 
Fargate usage, regardless of instance family, size, region, operating system, or tenancy.
Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that can help you reduce your bill by up to 72% compared to On-Demand prices, in exchange for a one- or 
three-year hourly spend commitment. AWS offers three types of Savings Plans: Compute Savings Plans, EC2 Instance Savings Plans, and 
Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans.
AWS recommends Savings Plans over Reserved Instances. Saving Plans are the easiest and most flexible way to save money on your AWS compute costs 
and offer lower prices (up to 72% off On-Demand pricing), just like Reserved Instances. However, Savings Plans are different to Reserved Instances. 
With Reserved Instances, you make a commitment to a specific instance configuration, whereas with Savings Plans, you have the flexibility to use 
the instance configurations that best meet your needs.

[answers]
Three subnets are created by default, with one subnet for each Availability Zone.
Three subnets are created by default in one Availability Zone.
A main route table is created by default.
An internet gateway is created by default
[correct]
A main route table is created by default.
[explanation]
By default, when you create a new VPC, a main route table is automatically created and associated with the VPC.
The main route table controls the routing for traffic within the VPC, directing traffic between subnets and to and from the internet gateway 
(if one is attached).
The main route table initially contains a default local route for communication within the VPC.
Subnets within the VPC inherit the main route table by default, but you can also create custom route tables and associate them with 
specific subnets if needed.

[q]
What best practice strategy should you follow when assigning permissions to IAM
users and groups?
[answers]
A. Follow the principle of least privilege.
B. Follow the principle of most privilege.
C. Follow the ITIL principles.
D. Follow the GDPR principle.
[correct]
A. Follow the principle of least privilege.
[explanation]
The principle of least privilege is a security best practice that advocates granting users only the permissions they need to perform their intended tasks, and nothing more.
By following the principle of least privilege, you minimize the potential impact of security breaches and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of resources.
Assigning minimal permissions limits the scope of potential security vulnerabilities and helps maintain a secure and well-controlled environment.
Following the principle of least privilege aligns with security best practices and helps organizations adhere to security compliance standards and regulations, such as those outlined by regulatory frameworks like HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.
In contrast, granting excessive or unnecessary privileges (the principle of most privilege) increases the attack surface and introduces unnecessary risks to the environment.



[q]
Which IAM service enables you to effectively manage users by creating a collection
of them based on their job function and assigning them permissions according to
their roles to the entire collective?
[answers]
A. IAM groups
B. IAM policies
C. IAM collection
D. IAM roles
[correct]
A. IAM groups
[explanation]
IAM (Identity and Access Management) groups in AWS are collections of IAM users. They are used to organize users into logical groups based on 
their roles, responsibilities, or permissions within an organization. By grouping users together, you can assign permissions to multiple users 
simultaneously, making it easier to manage access control in AWS.
An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage
the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called Admins and give that user group typical administrator permissions. 
Any user in that user group automatically has Admins group permissions. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges 
you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to the Admins user group. If a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of 
editing that user's permissions you can remove them from the old user groups and add them to the appropriate new user groups.



[q]
Which feature of IAM enables you to use your existing corporate Active Directory
user credentials to log in to the AWS Management Console and therefore offer an
SSO service?
[answers]
A. Identity federation
B. IAM user database
C. Active Directory users and computers
D. MFA
[correct]
A. Identity federation
[explanation]
Identity federation allows you to establish trust between your corporate identity provider (such as Active Directory) and AWS IAM. This enables 
your users to use their existing corporate credentials to access AWS resources without having to create separate IAM user accounts for each user. 
When a user attempts to access AWS resources, they are redirected to the corporate identity provider's login page for authentication. Once authenticated, 
the identity provider issues a security token that grants the user access to AWS services.
A federated identity is a user that can access secure AWS account resources with external identities. External identities can come from a 
corporate identity store (such as LDAP or Windows Active Directory) or from a third party (such as Login in with Amazon, Facebook, or Google). 
Federated identities don't sign in with the AWS Management Console or AWS access portal. The type of external identity in use determines how 
federated identities sign in.

[q]
What is the maximum limit of elastic IPs anyone can produce?
[answers]
50
10
5
100
[correct]
5
[explanation]
In Amazon Web Services (AWS), the maximum limit of elastic IP addresses (EIPs) that anyone can provision is 5 per AWS account by default. Elastic IP addresses are static IPv4 addresses that you can allocate and associate with your EC2 instances, providing persistent and fixed public IP addresses for your instances that remain associated with them until you choose to release or disassociate the addresses. While AWS allows you to allocate up to 5 EIPs per account, it's important to use them judiciously and consider alternative solutions such as using dynamic public IP addresses or leveraging NAT gateways and Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) where applicable to minimize the need for static IP addresses and optimize resource utilization and cost efficiency in your AWS environment.

[q]
What are the different types of EC2 instances based on their costs?
[answers]
On-demand Instance, Spot Instance, Annual
Spot Instance, Annual, Reserved Instance
On demand, Annual, Reserved Instance
On-demand Instance, Spot Instance, Reserved Instance
[correct]
On-demand Instance, Spot Instance, Reserved Instance
[explanation]
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances can be categorized into different types based on their cost models:

On-demand Instances: On-demand instances are billed per hour or per second based on your actual usage, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments required. You pay only for the compute capacity you consume, making on-demand instances ideal for short-term, temporary workloads with unpredictable usage patterns.
Spot Instances: Spot instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity at discounted prices compared to on-demand rates. You specify the maximum price you're willing to pay per hour for instances, and if your bid exceeds the current Spot market price, your instances are provisioned and run until the Spot price exceeds your bid or your instances are terminated by AWS due to capacity constraints.
Reserved Instances: Reserved instances offer significant cost savings compared to on-demand rates by allowing you to commit to a specific instance type in a specific region for a one- or three-year term. In exchange for making a upfront payment or choosing a partial upfront or no upfront payment option, you receive a discounted hourly rate for the duration of the reservation term, providing predictable pricing and long-term savings for steady-state workloads with predictable usage patterns.
[q]
VPC is not resolving the server through DNS. What might be the issue, and how can you fix it?
[answers]
Enable the DNS hostname resolution, so that the problem resolves itself.
Check security groups
Check NAT tables
Check if API Gateway is enabled
[correct]
Enable the DNS hostname resolution, so that the problem resolves itself.
[explanation]
If the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is not resolving the server through DNS, the likely issue is that DNS hostname resolution is not enabled for the VPC. To fix this issue, you should enable DNS hostname resolution for the VPC in the VPC settings. By enabling DNS hostname resolution, you allow instances within the VPC to resolve public DNS hostnames to IP addresses and private DNS hostnames to private IP addresses, enabling communication between instances and services using domain names instead of IP addresses. This ensures that DNS requests originating from instances within the VPC are resolved correctly, allowing applications and services to communicate with each other and external resources using domain names without encountering DNS resolution failures or errors.

Thoughts on caching:
    Not caching is less complicated from the frontend point of view.
    Caching = less lambda calls.
    But even if we the quizzes are < 10 questions the number of lambda calls can 
    increase exponentially as the number of users increase.
    No cachine makes it much harder to scale.
My recommendation would be that caching overweighs any extra complexity on the frontend
so we should go with that.
